### strides, depth and padding

### weights sharing
 We would like our CNNs to also possess this ability known as translation invariance. 
 Recognize objects regardless of their location in the image.
 
 If we want a cat thatâ€™s in the top left patch to be classified in the same way as a cat in the bottom right patch, 
 we need the weights and biases corresponding to those patches to be the same, so that they are classified the same way.
 
```python
new_height = (input_height - filter_height + 2 * P)/S + 1
new_width = (input_width - filter_width + 2 * P)/S + 1
```
