reward hypothesis: maximisation of expected accumulative reward

sequential decision making: select actions to maximise total future reward

Based on the observation and reward signal, the "brain" decides the action.

At each step, the (learning) agent

1. execute action
2. receive observation
3. receive scalar reward

The history is the sequence of observations, actions, rewards
